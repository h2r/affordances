We show, contrary to a widely held belief that discriminative classifiers are almost always to be preferred, that there can often be two distinct regimes of performance as the training set size is increased, one in which each algorithm does better. This stems from the observation -- which is borne out in repeated experiments -- that while discriminative learning has lower asymptotic error, a generative classifier may also approach its (higher) asymptotic error much faster.},

	comment = {(private-note)The authors present a conceptual representation (effectively a topological map) that allows them to refer to spatial and functional properties of indoor environments.  Place and object recognition is integrated into the system along with a linguistic framework.

They start with the value proposition that we want robots to communicate in terms that humans can understand.  Further, there is structure to particular places so that a living room often implies that particular objects (such as a couch or television) are present.

The related work section is particularly relevant.  The authors state that it is "nowadays generally assumed that humans adopt a partially heirarchical representation of spatial organization."  and that the basic units of qualitative spatial representation are topological structure.  In this work the authors present a spatial representation that is divided into layers and is the "centerpiece" of their integrated robotic system.

Overall, their contribution is basically in terms of integration.  They have SLAM working to build a map, place classification to determine whether a place is a doorway, hallway, or room.  Further, they integrate object recognition by simply matching SIFT features to a database.  Next there is a multi-layered spatial representation which is basically a metric line map to a navigation graph to a topological map to a semantic network which describes the relationships between objects in an environment.  The conceptual knowledge is specified in OWL-DL.  Finally, they add situated dialogue using this information.

Overall, it seems like there are few novel contributions from this work.  It is mostly an integration paper. },

However, while many location-aware applications can reason about space at the level of coordinates and containment relationships, they have no way to express the semantics that define how a particular space is used. We present Lair, an ontology that addresses this problem by modeling both the geographical relationships between spaces as well as the functional purpose of a given space. We describe how Lair was used to create an application that produces walking directions comparable to those given by a person, and a pilot study that evaluated the quality of these directions. We also describe how Lair can be used to evaluate other intelligent user interfaces.},

way by interacting with pedestrians in a natural and intuitive way and building a topological representation of its surroundings.
In a recent experiment the robot managed to successfully travel a 1.5‚Äâkm distance from the campus of the Technische Universit√§t
M√ºnchen to Marienplatz, the central square of Munich. This article describes the principles and system components for navigation
in urban environments, information retrieval through natural human-robot interaction, the construction of a suitable semantic
representation as well as results from the field experiment.

	comment = {(private-note)In this work the authors use semantic object context as a post processing step given an object recognition system.  They use a conditional random field to maximize label agreement according to contextual relevance.  The properties of objects in 1) interposition 2)support 3) position and 4) famaliar size has been addressed by the vision community, but 5)probability (objects tend to be found in some contexts and not others) has not been addressed as much.  The authors first segment the images, run classification to get a list of N labels for each segment, and then use context to figure out the most likely set of labels from the candidates.  To perform the classification, nearest neighbors is performed and the class with the lowest l\_1 distance is taken.

To incorporate semantic context, the authors use a fully connected CRF between segment labels.  In addition, they train a CRF on simpler problems on a relatively small number of segments.  They use google sets and also the Pascal dataset.  Hoewever, at the assignment stage, it does not appear that they use color or feature information directly from the image.},

In this paper we present a context-based vision system for place and object recognition. The goal is to identify familiar locations (e.g., office 610, conference room 941, Main Street), to categorize new environments (office, corridor, street) and to use that information to provide contextual priors for object recognition (e.g., table, chair, car, computer). We present a low-dimensional global image representation that provides relevant information for place recognition and categorization, and how such contextual information introduces strong priors that simplify object recognition. We have trained the system to recognize over 60 locations (indoors and outdoors) and to suggest the presence and locations of more than 20 different object types. The algorithm has been integrated into a mobile system that provides real-time feedback to the user.},

                 of Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Gaussian Mixture Regression
                 (GMR) and dynamical systems allows us to extract
                 redundancies across multiple demonstrations and build
                 time-independent models to reproduce the dynamics of the
                 demonstrated movements. The approach is first
                 systematically evaluated and compared with other
                 approaches by using generated trajectories sharing
                 similarities with human gestures. Three applications on
                 different types of robots are then presented. An
                 experiment with the iCub humanoid robot acquiring a
                 bimanual dancing motion is first presented to show that
                 the system can also handle cyclic motion. An experiment
                 with a 7 DOFs WAM robotic arm learning the motion of
                 hitting a ball with a table tennis racket is presented to
                 highlight the possibility to encode several variations of
                 a movement in a single model. Finally, an experiment with
                 a HOAP-3 humanoid robot learning to manipulate a spoon to
                 feed the Robota humanoid robot is presented to

We describe a systematic approach to construct the model from geometric data. In excess of the well-known topological relations, the model accounts for two important aspects of pedestrian navigation: firstly, visibility within spatial areas and, secondly, generating route descriptions. An algorithm is proposed which partitions spatial regions according to visibility criteria. It can handle simple polygons as encountered in floor plans. The model is structured hierarchically - each of its elements corresponds to a certain domain concept (‚Äòroom‚Äô, ‚Äòdoor‚Äô, ‚Äòfloor‚Äô etc.) and can be annotated with meta information. This is useful for applications in which such information have to be evaluated.},

	abstract = {Online mapping services and portable GPS units make it easy to get very detailed driving directions. While these directions are sufficient for an automaton to follow, they do not present a big picture description of the route. As a result, while people can follow these detailed turn-by-turn directions, it can be difficult for them to actually comprehend where they are going. Our goal is to make such directions more comprehensible. Our approach is to apply findings from human spatial cognition, the study of how people conceptualize and organize their knowledge of large-scale space, to create a system that generates written route overviews. Route overviews provide a big picture description of a route, and are intended to supplement the information in turn-by-turn directions. Our route overviews are based on cognitively-inspired design criteria such as: the use of spatial hierarchy, goal-directed descriptions, selective suppression of detail, and the use of the trunk segments and cognitive anchor points along the route. In our experiments, we show that we can make directions more comprehensible ‚Äî independent of the particular places a person knows ‚Äî by using what we know about how people think about space to structure the way we present spatial information.},

	comment = {(private-note)One of the main points of this work is that when generating route directions, people specify both what to do as well as the landmarks they will encounter along the route.  The goal of this study was for the authors to understand the cognitive function of landmarks.  They show that pedestrians perceived landmarks as a useful part of route directions.  They conclude that reference to landmarks is meant to help people to construct a mental representation of an unfamiliar environment and prepare them to get through difficult or uncertain parts of that environment.

The authors say that, "route directions can be summarized as the set of instructions that prescribe the actions required in order to execute that course, step by step, in an appropriate manner".  In order for these moves to lead the agent to a set of locations along the route, the agent will need to reorient itself.  Thus, the person generating route descriptions is attempting to communicate both \emph{procedures} and \emph{descriptions}  that allow an advance model of the environment to be traversed.  Further, the descriptions represent the frontal view of the environment.  Further, the default procedure is to move straight on.

There are three types of things that people will describe. (1) \emph{vectors} those things on which moves are executed (streets or roads) (2) \emph{points} or those things which are used to signal the position of a landmark (at the end of the street, at the top of the stairs). (3) \emph{objects} which are located along the vectors and correspond to regions of limited size.  

They show in their first experiment that walking directions through the Paris subway system that people would use an average of 11 or 12 landmarks (objects along the way).  In addition many participants would mention locations that were critical nodes in the path, or places where special difficulty will be encountered.

In their second experiment, they collected data that indicated what people thought was most important when they were given directions to follow a route. This part confirmed the importance of descriptive components (e.g. landmarks).

However, there is currently no accepted standard software solution available, so many research groups resort to developing and using their own custom software. In this paper, we present Version 4 of SwisTrack, an open source project for simultaneous tracking of multiple agents. While its broad range of pre-implemented algorithmic components allows it to be used in a variety of experimental applications, its novelty stands in its highly modular architecture. Advanced users can therefore also implement additional customized modules which extend the functionality of the existing components within the provided interface. This paper introduces SwisTrack and shows experiments with both marked and marker-less agents.},

Events are segmented simultaneously at multiple timescales, and are grouped hierarchically. Activity in brain regions including the posterior temporal and parietal cortex and lateral frontal cortex increases transiently at event boundaries. The parsing of ongoing activity into events is related to the updating of working memory, to the contents of long-term memory, and to the learning of new procedures. Event segmentation might arise as a side effect of an adaptive mechanism that integrates information over the recent past to improve predictions about the near future.},

At the core of the approach is a model of object schemas that enables a robot to encode beliefs about physical objects in its environment using collections of coupled processes responsible for sensorimotor interaction. These interaction processes run concurrently in order to ensure responsiveness to the environment, while co-ordinating sensorimotor expectations, action planning and language use. The model has been implemented on a robot that manipulates objects on a tabletop in response to verbal input. The implementation responds to verbal requests such as {'Group} the green block and the red apple', while adapting in real time to unexpected physical collisions and taking opportunistic advantage of any new information it may receive through perceptual and linguistic channels.},

	abstract = {This article describes the application of computational models of spatial prepositions to visually situated dialog systems. In these dialogs, spatial prepositions are important because people often use them to refer to entities in the visual context of a dialog. We first describe a generic architecture for a visually situated dialog system and highlight the interactions between the spatial cognition module, which provides the interface to the models of prepositional semantics, and the other components in the architecture. Following this, we present two new computational models of topological and projective spatial prepositions. The main novelty within these models is the fact that they account for the contextual effect which other distractor objects in a visual scene can have on the region described by a given preposition. We next present psycholinguistic tests evaluating our approach to distractor interference on prepositional semantics, and illustrate how these models are used for both interpretation and generation of prepositional expressions.},

	abstract = {Though both quantity and quality of semantic concept detection in video are continuously improving, it still remains unclear how to exploit these detected concepts as semantic indices in video search, given a specific query. In this paper, we tackle this problem and propose a video search framework which operates like searching text documents. Noteworthy for its adoption of the well-founded text search principles, this framework first selects a few related concepts for a given query, by employing a tf-idf like scheme, called c-tf-idf, to measure the informativeness of the concepts to this query. These selected concepts form a concept subspace. Then search can be conducted in this concept subspace, either by a Vector Model or a Language Model. Further, two algorithms, i.e., Linear Summation and Random Walk through {Concept-Link,} are explored to combine the concept search results and other baseline search results in a reranking scheme. This framework is both effective and efficient. Using a lexicon of 311 concepts from the {LSCOM} concept ontology, experiments conducted on the {TRECVID} 2006 search data set show that: when used solely, search within the concept subspace achieves the state-of-the-art concept search result; when used to rerank the baseline results, it can improve over the top 20 automatic search runs in {TRECVID} 2006 on average by approx. 20\%, on the most significant one by approx. 50\%, all within 180 milliseconds on a normal {PC.}},

Recently, there has been a growing interest in organizing systematic evaluations to compare the various techniques. Unfortunately, the lack of common metrics for measuring the performance of multiple object trackers still makes it hard to compare their results. In this work, we introduce two intuitive and general metrics to allow for objective comparison of tracker characteristics, focusing on their precision in estimating object locations, their accuracy in recognizing object configurations and their ability to consistently label objects over time. These metrics have been extensively used in two large-scale international evaluations, the 2006 and 2007 {CLEAR} evaluations, to measure and compare the performance of multiple object trackers for a wide variety of tracking tasks. Selected performance results are presented and the advantages and drawbacks of the presented metrics are discussed based on the experience gained during the evaluations.},

Children watched the action that matched the requested verb significantly more than they watched the action that did not match the verb.

The effect could be the result of either presenting the human form in a novel orientation or presenting the event of walking in a novel orientation, as the two are confounded in the case of walking on feet. This study teased apart the effects of object and event orientation by examining detection accuracy for upright and inverted displays of a point-light figure walking on his hands. Detection of this walker was greater in the upright display, which had a familiar event orientation and an unfamiliar object orientation, than in the inverted display, which had a familiar object orientation and an unfamiliar event orientation. This finding supports accounts of event perception and recognition that are based on spatiotemporal patterns of motion associated with the dynamics of an event.},

	title = {Modeling background activity for behavior subtraction},
	abstract = {The detection of events that differ from what is considered normal is, arguably, the most important task for camera-based surveillance. Clearly, the definition of normal behavior differs from one application to another, and, therefore, approaches to its detection differ as well. In the case of intrusion monitoring, simple motion detection may be sufficient, such as based on background luminance/color modeling. However, in more complex scenarios, such as the detection of abandoned luggage, more advanced approaches have been developed, often relying on object path modeling. In this paper, we describe a new model for representing normality. Our model, that we call a behavior image, is low-dimensional and based on dynamics of luminance/color profiles, however it does not require explicit estimation of object paths. The process of estimating visual abnormality is then a simple comparison of training and observed behavior images, that we call behavior subtraction. We describe a new practical implementation of our model that is based on average activity. It is easy to program and requires little processing power and memory. Moreover, it is robust to motion detection errors, such as those resulting from parasitic background motion (e.g., heavy rain/snow, camera jitter). Most importantly, however, the method is not content-specific, and, therefore, is applicable to the monitoring of humans, cars or other objects in both uncluttered and highly-cluttered scenes. We support these claims by including various experimental results, from urban traffic, through sport scenes to natural environment.},

The reference application is a silent and automatic control of the behaviour of people living alone in the house and specially conceived for people with limited autonomy (e.g., elders or disabled people). The aim is to detect dangerous events (such as a person falling down) and to react to these events by establishing a remote connection with low-performance clients, such as {PDA} {(Personal} Digital Assistant). To this aim, we propose an integrated server architecture, typically connected in intranet with network cameras, able to segment and track objects of interest; in the case of objects classified as people, the system must also evaluate the people posture and infer possible dangerous situations. Finally, the system is equipped with a specifically designed transcoding server to adapt the video content to {PDA} requirements (display area and bandwidth) and to the user's requests. The main issues of the proposal are a reliable real-time object detector and tracking module, a simple but effective posture classifier improved by a supervised learning phase, and an high performance transcoding inspired on {MPEG-4} object-level standard, tailored to {PDA.} Results on different video sequences and performance analysis are discussed.},

  abstract	= {Following natural language instructions requires
		  transforming language into situated conditional procedures;
		  robustly following instructions, despite the director's
		  natural mistakes and omissions, requires the pragmatic
		  combination of language, action, and domain knowledge. This
		  dissertation demonstrates a software agent that parses,
		  models and executes human-written natural language
		  instructions to accomplish complex navigation tasks. We
		  compare the performance against people following the same
		  instructions. By selectively removing various syntactic,
		  semantic, and pragmatic abilities, this work empirically
		  measures how often these abilities are necessary to
		  correctly navigate along extended routes through unknown,
		  large-scale environments to novel destinations. To study
		  how route instructions are written and followed, this work
		  presents a new corpus of 1520 free-form instructions from
		  30 directors for 252 routes in three virtual environments.
		  101 other people followed these instructions and rated them
		  for quality, successfully reaching and identifying the
		  destination on only approximately two-thirds of the trials.
		  Our software agent, MARCO, followed the same instructions
		  in the same environments with a success rate approaching
		  human levels. Overall, instructions subjectively rated 4 or
		  better of 6 comprise just over half of the corpus; MARCO
		  performs at 88\% of human performance on these
		  instructions. MARCO's performance was a strong predictor of
		  human performance and ratings of individual instructions.
		  Ablation experiments demonstrate that implicit procedures
		  are crucial for following verbal instructions using an
		  approach integrating language, knowledge and action. Other
		  experiments measure the performance impact of linguistic,
		  execution, and spatial abilities in successfully following
		  natural language route instructions.},

	title = {Wayfinding choremes--a language for modeling conceptual route knowledge},
	volume = {16},
	abstract = {
The emergent interest in ontological and conceptual approaches to modeling route information results from new information technologies as well as from a multidisciplinary interest in spatial cognition. Linguistics investigates verbal route directions; cartography carries out research on route maps and on the information needs of map users; and computer science develops formal representations of routes with the aim to build new wayfinding applications. In concert with geomatics, ontologies of spatial domain knowledge are assembled while sensing technologies for location-aware wayfinding aids are developed simultaneously (e.g. cell phones, {GPS-enabled} devices or {PDAs).} These joint multidisciplinary efforts have enhanced cognitive approaches for route directions.
In this article, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to modeling route information, the wayfinding choreme theory. Wayfinding choremes are mental conceptualizations of functional wayfinding and route direction elements. With the wayfinding choreme theory, we propose a formal treatment of (mental) conceptual route knowledge that is based on qualitative calculi and refined by behavioral experimental research. This contribution has three parts: First, we introduce the theory of wayfinding choremes. Second, we present term rewriting rules that are grounded in cognitive principles and can tailor route directions to different user requirements. Third, we exemplify various application scenarios for our approach.},

The approach combines concepts from semiotics and schema theory to develop a holistic approach to linguistic meaning. Schemas serve as structured beliefs that are grounded in an agent's physical environment through a causal-predictive cycle of action and perception. Words and basic speech acts are interpreted in terms of grounded schemas. The framework reflects lessons learned from implementations of several language processing robots.

In our research, we have been investigating the use of spatial relationships to establish a natural communication mechanism between people and robots, in particular, for novice users. In this paper, the work on robot spatial relationships is combined with a multimodal robot interface. We show how linguistic spatial descriptions and other spatial information can be extracted from an evidence grid map and how this information can be used in a natural, human-robot dialog. Examples using spatial language are included for both robot-to-human feedback and also human-to-robot commands. We also discuss some linguistic consequences in the semantic representations of spatial and locative information based on this work.},

We present a mechanism for connecting a spatial language query to a video clip corresponding to the query. The system can retrieve video clips matching millions of potential queries that describe complex events in video such as "people walking from the hallway door, around the island, to the kitchen sink." By breaking down the query into a sequence of independent structured clauses and modeling the meaning of each component of the structure separately, we are able to improve on previous approaches to video retrieval by finding clips that match much longer and more complex queries using a rich set of spatial relations such as "down" and "past." We present a rigorous analysis of the system's performance, based on a large corpus of task-constrained language collected from fourteen subjects. Using this corpus, we show that the system effectively retrieves clips that match natural language descriptions: 58.3\% were ranked in the top two of ten in a retrieval task. Furthermore, we show that spatial relations play an important role in the system's performance.},
